# Web-based-Calculator
The project creates a basic calculator interface using HTML, styled with CSS, and made functional using JavaScript.

The HTML structure includes a container with an input display and multiple rows of buttons for digits and operations.

Each button is an <input type="button">, and the display is an <input type="text"> showing user input and results.

The CSS uses Flexbox to center the calculator on the screen and style buttons and layout for a modern look.

The display area is styled to look like a digital screen — right-aligned, large font, and borderless.

Buttons are styled with shadows, spacing, and hover effects for a soft 3D appearance.

JavaScript is added to listen for button clicks and update the display dynamically.

Special buttons like "AC" (clear), "DE" (delete), and "=" (evaluate) have specific logic in JavaScript.

The eval() function is used to compute the entered expression safely (with caution in real-world apps).
Overall, the project demonstrates core web development skills — combining layout, styling, and interactivity.
